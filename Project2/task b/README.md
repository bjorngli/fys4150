# FYS4150 Project 2 Task b
Finding out how many iterations are needed to solve an eigenvalue problem when the dimension of the matrix increases.

## Dependencies
gFortran, Python with matplotlib and laTeX

## NB!
Delete dimension.dat and iterations.dat after every run! Had problems with finding a good way to write the values to file so as of now it's
done by appending which, if the .dat files are not deleted, will continue to write in the .dat file repeating itself.
